# Multi-dimensional Life Model

This framework provides a holistic and multi-dimensional perspective on different aspects of human experience. It combines the concepts of sphere of life, element, zodiac sign, arcane tarot, and alchemical stage to provide a more complete and nuanced understanding of different areas of life.

**Note**: This is a symbolic and metaphorical system and the associations are not definitive. It's important to remember that these concepts are open to interpretation. This is not a guide to action, in the process of studying the topic, I decided **just for fun** to describe it in the context of an IT solution.

The order of the spheres in the table is important because it represents the progression of personal development and growth. The spheres are arranged in a logical sequence, starting with the self (Image) and moving outward to the community (Friendship) and then to transformation (Trans). Each sphere builds on the previous one, as a person develops their sense of self, their relationships, and their ability to adapt and change.

If the spheres were connected cyclically in a circle, it would imply that personal development and growth are a continuous process. It suggests that all spheres are interconnected and influencing each other, and that a person can return to any sphere at any time, to work on it and improve it. The cycle would also suggest that the end and the beginning are not distinct, and that the person's development is a never-ending process.

## Field
Kurt Lewin's concept of Field theory can be applied to the overall discussion of spheres of life, elements, zodiac signs, arcane tarot, alchemical stage and energy. According to Lewin, a person's behavior is shaped by the psychological field in which they are located. This field is made up of three elements: the person, the environment, and the behavior that connects them.

For example, in the sphere of Image, the person may have a strong desire for self-expression (energy) but may be limited by societal norms and expectations (environment) which may affect their behavior and the way they present themselves to the world. In the sphere of Economy, the person may have a strong sense of practicality and stability (energy) but may be limited by financial resources (environment) which may affect their behavior in managing resources.

By applying Lewin's concept of Field theory, we can understand how the individual's unique characteristics, elements, zodiac signs, arcane tarot, alchemical stage, and energy interact with the environment to shape their behavior in each sphere of life.

### Forces 
There are also two forces that act upon the field of life. These forces are: 
1. Attraction – This is the force that draws us towards certain goals, people, and experiences. 
2. Repulsion – This is the force that pushes us away from certain goals, people, and experiences. 

In context of forces exists:
1. Balance – This is the combination of forces that helps us to maintain equilibrium in our lives. 
2. Transformation – This is the combination of forces that helps us to evolve and grow. 

These forces act upon the field of life in order to create a dynamic and ever-changing environment. 

### Particles 
In addition to the forces, there are also particles that exist in the field of life. These particles are made up of energy. These particles interact with the forces to create a unique and ever-changing environment. 

In the context of field theory, objects in the field may have polarities, valences, or charges that influence their interactions with other objects in the field.

* **Polarity** refers to the positive or negative nature of an object in the field, which can influence its interactions with other objects in the field. For example, a positive self-image can attract positive opportunities and interactions, while a negative self-image can repel them.
* **Valence** refers to the degree of attraction or repulsion that an object in the field has for other objects in the field. For example, an individual with a strong and positive self-image may have a high valence for positive social interactions, while an individual with a negative self-image may have a low valence for these interactions.
* **Charge** refers to the amount of energy that an object in the field has, which can influence its interactions with other objects in the field. For example, an individual with a positive self-image may have a high charge of energy and motivation, which can attract positive opportunities, while an individual with a negative self-image may have a low charge of energy and motivation, which can repel these opportunities.

### Flow 
The flow of the field of life is the combination of the attraction, repulsion, balance and transformation forces. 

### Patterns 
The patterns of the field of life are the combination of the particles and fields that make up the field. 

### Complex structures in Field 
The field of life is a complex system that is constantly in motion and is constantly changing. However, within this system there are some patterns that remain consistent.

In this framework, each sphere of life can be associated with specific field entities that correspond to different aspects of the individual's experience.
* **Image**: physical appearance, body, and sense of self.
* **Economy**: financial and material resources.
* **Study**: cognitive abilities, awareness, and understanding.

## Energy Flow
Kurt Lewin's Change Model provides a useful framework for understanding the flow of energy in each sphere of life. According to this model, the flow of energy is cyclical in nature and involves four stages: Unfreezing, Changing, Refreezing, and Sustaining. 

In the Unfreezing stage, one must let go of old habits and beliefs in order to make room for new ones. In the Changing stage, one must take action in order to move towards desired goals. In the Refreezing stage, one must solidify the changes that have been made and ensure that they will be sustained. Finally, in the Sustaining stage, one must continue to take action in order to maintain the desired changes. By understanding this cyclical flow of energy, one can gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively work within each sphere of life in order to achieve one's desired outcomes.

The concept of flow in the context of spheres of life can also refer to the idea of a smooth, natural and effortless movement of energy between the different spheres. This can be compared to the flow of a river, where the water moves seamlessly and naturally between different areas, providing nourishment and growth along the way.

In this sense, a person who has a balanced and healthy flow of energy between the different spheres of life, can feel fulfilled, energized and aligned in different aspects of their life. They can move through different spheres with ease, without feeling stuck or blocked in any particular area. This flow of energy can be multidimensional, meaning that it can involve different layers of emotions, thoughts and physical sensations that allow the person to feel grounded, balanced and harmonious.

On the other hand, a person who does not have a healthy flow of energy between the spheres may feel disconnected and unaligned, experiencing blockages in different areas of their life, leading them to feel unfulfilled and disconnected. Thus, having a healthy flow of energy between spheres is key to achieving balance and fulfillment in life.

### Flow between shperes
Here are a few examples of how energy flow between spheres of life could work based on the concepts presented in the Multi-dimensional Life Model:

* In the sphere of Image, individuals focus on developing a positive self-image and personal charm. This can lead to an increase in self-confidence and self-esteem, which can then be channeled into the sphere of Work, leading to increased productivity and success in one's career.
* In the sphere of Study, individuals focus on expanding their awareness and knowledge. This can lead to an increase in creativity, which can then be channeled into the sphere of Art, leading to the creation of more meaningful and impactful works of art.
* In the sphere of Family, individuals focus on fostering strong relationships and a sense of community. This can lead to an increase in empathy and understanding, which can then be channeled into the sphere of Love, leading to deeper and more meaningful relationships.
* In the sphere of Health, individuals focus on taking care of their physical and mental well-being. This can lead to an increase in vitality and inspiration, which can then be channeled into the sphere of Sex, leading to a more fulfilling and satisfying sexual life.
* In the sphere of Altruism, individuals focus on selflessness and serving others. This can lead to an increase in personal growth and self-awareness, which can then be channeled into the sphere of Trans, leading to greater flexibility and adaptability in different aspects of life.

### Flow Patterns



1. **Integration**: Integrating different aspects of the spheres of life to create a cohesive and harmonious whole. For example, incorporating physical activity and self-care practices into one's daily routine can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Health and Image.
2. **Circulation**: Circulating energy between different spheres to create a balance and harmony. For example, regularly engaging in social activities and networking can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Friendship and Work.
3. **Expansion**: Expanding energy from one sphere to another to create a sense of interconnectedness. For example, exploring new cultures and perspectives can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Study and Trans.
4. **Reflection**: This flow pattern involves reflecting on the energy in one sphere to understand how it relates to other spheres. For example, reflecting on one's personal values and beliefs can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Altruism and Image.
5. **Empowerment**: This flow pattern involves empowering oneself with the energy from one sphere to enhance the energy in another. For example, empowering oneself with financial stability can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Economy and Image.
7. **Release**: This flow pattern involves releasing any blockages or tension in one sphere to enhance the flow of energy in another. For example, releasing stress and tension from work can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Work and Health.
8. **Amplification**: This flow pattern involves amplifying energy from one sphere to enhance the energy in another. For example, amplifying creativity and self-expression in the sphere of Art can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Art and Image.
9. **Harmonization**: This flow pattern involves harmonizing energy from one sphere with energy from another to create a sense of balance and harmony. For example, harmonizing personal values and beliefs with professional goals can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Altruism and Work.
10. **Synchronicity**: This flow pattern involves a sense of synchronicity and interconnectedness between different spheres. For example, feeling a sense of synchronicity between personal growth and career development can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Trans and Work.
11. **Amplification**: This flow pattern involves amplifying energy from one sphere to enhance the energy in another. For example, amplifying one's altruistic actions can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Altruism and Health.
12. **Regeneration**: This flow pattern involves regenerating energy from one sphere to enhance the energy in another. For example, regenerating energy from sexual experiences can help to enhance the flow of energy between the spheres of Sex and Love.

## Getting Started

The framework is divided into different spheres of life, each representing a different area of human experience. Remember that each sphere is just one aspect of yourself, and it's important to have a balance of all spheres of life.

To get started, you can choose a sphere of life that you want to focus on, and then use the framework to gain a deeper understanding and insight into that sphere.

1. Choose a sphere of life that you want to focus on.
2. Identify your current state in that sphere.
3. Set goals for yourself in that sphere.
4. Use the framework to gain a deeper understanding and insight into that sphere, including the associated element, zodiac sign, arcane tarot, and alchemical stage.
5. Take action towards your goals.
6. Reflect on your progress and make adjustments as needed.

## Requirements for Life
The minimum balance between owning resources in the context of the different spheres of life can vary depending on an individual's needs and priorities. However, generally speaking, having a balance of resources in each sphere of life can provide a person with confident stability and protection.

For example, in the sphere of Image, owning resources such as self-confidence and a positive self-image can provide a sense of stability and protection in terms of one's self-esteem and self-worth. In the sphere of Economy, owning resources such as financial stability and security can provide a sense of stability and protection in terms of one's ability to meet basic needs and have a sense of financial independence. In the sphere of Study, owning resources such as knowledge and education can provide a sense of stability and protection in terms of one's ability to navigate the world and make informed decisions.

It is important to note that this is a general scenario, and each person's situation can differ. It is also worth mentioning that some people may prioritize some spheres more than others, and it's not necessary to have resources in all spheres to live a fulfilling life.

### Lack of Resources
A person who lacks resources in the sphere of:
* Image: may have low self-esteem and self-worth, which can impact their ability to form healthy relationships and achieve their goals.
* Economy: may struggle to meet their basic needs and may be at risk of financial insecurity.
* Study: may struggle to navigate the world and make informed decisions, which can impact their ability to succeed in their career or education. 
* Family: may struggle to maintain healthy relationships and may feel isolated and unsupported.
* Art: may feel unfulfilled and may lack a sense of purpose or creativity. 
* Health: may struggle with physical or emotional well-being, and may be at risk of illness or stress. 
* Altruism: may lack a sense of purpose and social responsibility, and may have difficulty connecting with others.
* Work: may struggle to achieve their goals and may feel unmotivated or unproductive. 
* Friendship: may feel isolated and lonely, and may have difficulty building and maintaining healthy relationships.
* Trans: may struggle to navigate change and personal growth, and may feel stuck or unfulfilled in their life.
